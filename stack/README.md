# Stacks

A Stack is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.

This feature means that built-in Array works well for implementation as only the last element in the array will be accessed.

We will allow Javascript to handle the dynamic resizing of the stack.

# Common Methods (or Properties)

## Push
Add an element to the top of the stack.

## Pop
Removes the top most element in the stack and returns it.

## Peek
Returns the top most element in the stack, however, does not remove it from the stack.

## IsEmpty
Returns a boolean evaluation of whether or not the stack is empty.

## Print

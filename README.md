# Javascript Data Structures

This repo is meant as an exploration of common data structures.

It uses Javascript to implement the common methods associated with the data structures.

In certain situations, it uses built-in methods for simplicity.

| Data Structure | ES6 Class | Prototypal | Psuedoclassical |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Arrays](./arrays/README.md) | [Array Class](./arrays/arrayClass.js) | [Array Prototypal](./arrays/arrayPrototypal.js) | [Array Psuedoclassical](./arrays/arrayPseudoclassical.js)|
| Binary Search Tree (BST) | | |
| Graph | | |
| Hash Table | | |
| Linked List (Doubly) | | |
| Linked List (Singly) | | |
| Queue | | |
| Set | | |
| Stack | | |
| Tree | | |
| Trie | | |
